Backfire has several major infrastructure pieces that are detailed here.

Backfire has a 48' x 30' EMT shade structure.  The first part was purchased from the fine people at Black Rock Hardware for the 2016 Burn.  The next expansion came in 2019 where we purchased our own EMT and accessories to expand the existing structure to 48' x 30'
